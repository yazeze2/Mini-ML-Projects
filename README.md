# Mini ML Projects
Repository containing data science projects completed by me for academic, purposes using Python and MATLAB. All the projects listed here are completed without the use of any pre-built machine learning Libraries

# Contents

- [Multilayer Perceptron for Handwritten Digit Classification](https://github.com/yazeze2/Multilayer-PTA-for-Handwritten-Digit-Classification-Recognition) - Multilayer perceptron for Handwritten Digit Classification on MNIST dataset
- [Neural Networks Backpropagation for Siusodial Curve fitting](https://github.com/yazeze2/Curve-Fitting_Backpropagation_python) - In this project the backpropagation algorithm was used to fit a given sinusoidal function
- [Support Vector Machines for non-linear data classification](https://github.com/yazeze2/Support-Vector-Machine-SVM-) - The goal of this project was to classify two non-linear classes in which the data points for one class are bounded within a Moon and Mountain  shaped boundaries while the data points for the other class rest outside of these boundaries.
